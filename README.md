**Predicting whether online orders will be delivered on time or delayed â€” an end-to-end machine learning pipeline project built from scratch.**

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting delivery delays in Brazilian e-commerce orders using real-world data from [Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), keep in mind the data source in the folder data/ has been slightly modified by me.
